# sudoku-helper

A tool for providing tips to solving a sudoku app. I don't know quite what it
will do yet.

## TODOs

- [x] Add `solve` function
- [x] Add `isFinished` function
- [ ] Strong lines for separating squares of 3x3 blocks
- [ ] GUI instead of creating svg images
- Additional solvers:
  - [ ] hidden single
  - [ ] naked pair/triple/etc.
  - [ ] hidden pair/triple/etc.
  - [ ] x-wing
  - [ ] BUG +1 - should be fairly straightforward
